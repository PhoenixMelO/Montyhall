Description: This package was created to simulate the Montyhall game. The game 
consists of a contestant choosing between 3 doors. Behind the three doors, there 
are two doors and a car. The objective of the game is for the contestant to 
select the door with the car behind it. The contestant is asked to choose a 
door. After the door is chosen, the game eliminates one of the doors that have a 
goat behind it. This reduces the choices to the door the contestant chose and 
another door. The contestant is given the opportunity to stay with the door that 
they initially chose or switch to the other door. The game then determines if 
the contestant’s door is the door with the car behind it and declares them to 
either “Win” or “Lose”. The game is simulated 100 times to see if there is a 
pattern with choice.
